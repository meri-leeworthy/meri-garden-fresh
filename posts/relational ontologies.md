>Mangrove forests are primary examples of relational ontologies. The mangrove-world is enacted minute by minute, day by day, through an infinite set of practices carried out by a multiplicity of beings and life forms, involving complex weavings of water, minerals, degrees of salinity, forms of energy (sun, tides, moon), human activity, spiritual beings, and so forth. There is a rhizome-like logic to these entanglements, very difficult to map and measure, if at all; this logic reveals an altogether different way of being and becoming in territory and place. ==Said otherwise, things and beings are their relations; they do not exist prior to them.== From a capitalist perspective, transforming them from “worthless swamp” to agroindustrial complexes is a laudable aim (Ogden 2011). In these cases, the insatiable appetite of the [[One-World World|OWW]] spells out the progressive destruction of the mangrove-world, its ontological capture and reconversion by capital and the State ([[A Thousand Plateaus|Deleuze and Guattari 1987]]; Escobar 2008, 2014). The OWW, in short, denies the mangrove-world the possibility of existing as such. Local struggles constitute attempts to re/establish some degree of symmetry to the partial connections that the mangrove-worlds maintain with the OWW.
